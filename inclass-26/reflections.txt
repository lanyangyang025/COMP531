• What did you hope to learn but did not?
At first, I only want to learn some basic Web skills, like Javascript, HTML and CSS. For me, I learned more than I expected at the begining. The only skill I don't learn from the class while I wish to learn at first is PHP. But from the class, Scott said that it's an easy and outdated technology. I think I could learn it quickly if I have to use in the future.


• What did you really enjoy learning about?
I really like the knowledge of frontend. It gives me a better learning about the Web. Before I learn the course, I regarded the Web as the frontend. After I learn the course, I know the knowledge far more than the frontend.


• What worked well in the course? and how?
Scott is really nice! He is very kind and helpful! And he has a good teaching skill. I could learn a lot from his class!


• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
The homework is really difficult. Sometimes I'm really confused about the homework. I hope Scott could teach more on on how to write the code.
And the content in the class is too overwhelming to me.


• What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
I think you could provide more material related to the content before class so that we could have a better knowledge on what you are saying.


• Anything else you like to say?
I really like the class. Although it's a heavy burden to me, I learn a lot from the course. I pretty appreciate what you taught in class!
