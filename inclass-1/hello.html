    <h2> Last Trip </h2>
    <p> Last year I went to Yunnan province. It has lots of beautiful sceneries,
     including <em>Lugu Lake</em>, <em>Xianggelila</em> and <em>Yulong Snowmountain</em>. All these places are in a high altitude and it's really 
     tiring to go to these places. Often we have to take several hours to drive along sinuous mountain roads.
    However, these works are worthy since these sceneries are so fantastic that it seems as if you are in a fairyland.
