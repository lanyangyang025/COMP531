1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why? 
The presentation I like best is “AngularJS4”. The presentation is clear, and I could know clearly about the author’s viewpoint. The powerpoint is clear as well.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn? 
The topic I learnt most is called “Unit Test Frameworks”. The author summarizes many unit frameworks we used in previous homework. From the homework, I only know how to write the code, while from the speech, I know deeper about the definition of these frameworks, how to use them and when to use them.


3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
I appreciate all the talks. But I appreciate most is “React Native”. The author spoke clearly, the powerpoint is good, and the content is closely related to our class. I know the something about React Naïve, a technology based on React and Javascript. I expand my knowledge, and have a better understanding of I learnt.
